## Technologies and tools used 

## Test scenarios 
- Testing the user interface across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Verifying respionsiveness on different screen sizes
- Evaluating load times and performance under different network conditions
- Testing user acceptability with a prospective user

## Risk and security considerations 

 ## Accurate estimate of work and level of parallelization
- Tasks should be divided into smaller subtasks, with completion times estimated for each.
- Finding dependencies between activities to identify potential for parallelization
- Team size and availability of team members will be considered when estimating work
- Use of Kanban boards to visualize the timeline and parallelization of tasks
